        "title": "Tech Careers You‚Äôve Never Heard Of (But Totally Could Rock!)",
        "author": "Girl Tech",
        "body": """
        <p>When most people hear "tech job," they imagine someone glued to a screen, typing endless lines of code. But the truth? Tech is way more diverse ‚Äî and creative ‚Äî than you might think. Whether you're analytical, artistic, strategic, or somewhere in between, there's a role for you. And spoiler alert: women are already killing it in these spaces.</p>
    
          <p>Here are five tech careers you <strong>might not have heard of</strong> ‚Äî but that you could totally thrive in:</p>
    
          <h2>üí° UX Designer (User Experience Designer)</h2>
          <p>If you‚Äôre the kind of person who notices when an app feels clunky or a website just <em>works</em>, UX design might be your thing. UX designers make digital experiences smooth, intuitive, and user-friendly. It‚Äôs where psychology, creativity, and empathy meet design. And the best part? You don‚Äôt need to code ‚Äî just an eye for what feels right.</p>
    
          <h2>üîê Cybersecurity Analyst</h2>
          <p>Love solving puzzles or spotting when something feels off? Cybersecurity is about protecting data and systems from hackers and cyber threats. With digital safety becoming more important than ever, cybersecurity analysts are in high demand ‚Äî and women are underrepresented. That means: massive opportunity.</p>
    
          <h2>üß† Data Ethics Specialist</h2>
          <p>As tech gets smarter (think AI and big data), we need people who can ask, "Is this the right thing to do?" Data ethics specialists work at the intersection of tech, law, and morality. If you care about fairness, privacy, and accountability, this is a growing space where your voice matters.</p>
    
          <h2>ü§ñ AI Prompt Engineer</h2>
          <p>This one's new ‚Äî and super cool. Prompt engineers write clever instructions for AI tools like ChatGPT to get the best results. It's part communication, part creativity, part logic. No coding required, just clear thinking and a playful approach to language and problem-solving.</p>
    
          <h2>üìà Product Manager</h2>
          <p>Think of this as the CEO of a product. Product managers work with designers, developers, and marketers to turn an idea into something real. If you're organised, love bringing people together, and enjoy solving problems from a big-picture view, this is your jam.</p>
    
          <p>So whether you‚Äôre tech-curious, mid-career, or just exploring ‚Äî don‚Äôt let the word ‚Äútech‚Äù scare you. There‚Äôs room for storytellers, organisers, artists, thinkers, and dreamers.</p>
    
          <p><strong>The future of tech is diverse ‚Äî and we want you in it.</strong></p>

    "networking-tips": {
        "title": "Conquer the Crowd: Networking Like a Pro (New Girl in Tech Edition!)",
        "author": "Girl Tech",
        "body": """
        <p>You‚Äôre new to tech. You‚Äôve got your first networking event coming up. And if we‚Äôre being real? The idea of entering a room full of confident, experienced professionals is‚Ä¶ intimidating. But don‚Äôt panic ‚Äî this is your chance to shine, learn, and start building your tribe in tech!</p>
    
            <h2>üîç Before You Go: Prep Like a Pro</h2>
            <p>Think of this as your mission briefing. Start by researching the event. Check out the speakers, scan the attendee list (if available), and look up the companies or topics being covered. This prep will help you feel grounded and give you conversation starters.</p>
    
            <p>Now, the magic move: create your elevator pitch. Just 20‚Äì30 seconds of who you are, what you‚Äôre into, and what you‚Äôre hoping to gain. Keep it natural, and practice until it flows confidently ‚Äî not like a robot.</p>
    
            <p>Pro tip: pack business cards (yes, even basic ones), a notebook, and a pen. Dress smart-casual or whatever makes you feel like your most powerful self. Confidence is half the battle.</p>
    
            <h2>üåü At the Event: Dive In</h2>
            <p>Take a breath. You belong here. Everyone started somewhere. Begin with low-pressure conversations ‚Äî someone standing solo, or a small, relaxed group. Smile, introduce yourself, and ask open-ended questions like: ‚ÄúWhat brought you here today?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs been your favourite part of the event so far?‚Äù</p>
    
            <p>Listen like you mean it. Don‚Äôt just wait to speak ‚Äî really engage. People appreciate feeling heard, and it makes you way more memorable.</p>
    
            <p>It‚Äôs totally okay to ask for advice! Try: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm new to the industry and curious about [topic] ‚Äî do you have any tips for someone just starting out?‚Äù Most people love to share wisdom ‚Äî and it sparks meaningful conversation.</p>
    
            <h2>üì© After the Event: Keep the Spark Alive</h2>
            <p>Networking doesn‚Äôt stop at the venue doors. Follow up within a couple of days. Send a thoughtful LinkedIn request or a quick email referencing your chat. It shows you were paying attention ‚Äî and keeps the door open.</p>
    
            <p>Want to learn more from someone you clicked with? Ask for a virtual coffee. A 15-minute chat can lead to mentorship, internships, or even your next big break.</p>
    
            <h2>üí¨ Final Word: You‚Äôve Got This</h2>
            <p>Tech is full of amazing, welcoming people. Show up as yourself ‚Äî enthusiastic, curious, and ready to grow. Your perspective matters, and your fresh energy is an asset. </p>
    
            <p>Networking isn‚Äôt about collecting contacts. It‚Äôs about building real, human connections. So go ahead: step into that room, start that conversation, and <strong>own your space</strong> in tech.</p>

    "salary-talk": {
        "title": "Navigating the Numbers: Salary Talk for New Girls in Tech",
        "author": "Girl Tech",
        "body": """
        <p>Ah, the salary question ‚Äî the moment that can make even the most confident tech newbie sweat. ‚ÄúWhat are your salary expectations?‚Äù or worse, ‚ÄúWhat are you currently making?‚Äù Cue the internal panic. But guess what? You‚Äôve got this.</p>
    
            <h2>üìä Know Your Worth</h2>
            <p>Before you walk into any interview, come armed with knowledge. Use tools like Glassdoor, Payscale, and LinkedIn Salary to get a sense of the going rate for your role, experience level, and location. Your number isn‚Äôt random ‚Äî it‚Äôs a reflection of your value. Research is power.</p>
    
            <h2>üö´ Skip the Salary History Trap</h2>
            <p>In many places, it‚Äôs illegal to ask about your past pay ‚Äî and even where it‚Äôs legal, you don‚Äôt have to answer. Try this: <strong>‚ÄúI‚Äôm focused on the value I bring to this role and prefer to discuss salary based on the market rate.‚Äù</strong> Professional, clear, and puts the focus where it belongs: forward.</p>
    
            <h2>üí¨ Talk Ranges, Not Exact Numbers</h2>
            <p>Instead of locking yourself into a single figure, offer a well-researched range. For example: <strong>‚ÄúBased on my research, I‚Äôm looking for something in the range of 60 to 70k, depending on the full package.‚Äù</strong> Flexibility shows confidence and leaves room for negotiation.</p>
    
            <h2>üåü Lead with Value</h2>
            <p>Don‚Äôt just talk about what you want ‚Äî talk about what you bring. Highlight your skills, enthusiasm, and what you‚Äôll contribute. <em>‚ÄúWith my background in UX and project coordination, I‚Äôm confident I can make an immediate impact on your product team.‚Äù</em></p>
    
            <h2>üßæ Look at the Full Picture</h2>
            <p>Salary is just one slice of the pie. Think about health benefits, remote work, learning stipends, mental health days, and career growth opportunities. These all add serious value to your total package.</p>
    
            <h2>üó£Ô∏è Practice Makes Powerful</h2>
            <p>Negotiation is a skill, and like any skill ‚Äî you get better with practice. Do a mock run with a friend, mentor, or even in the mirror. The more you say it out loud, the more confident you‚Äôll feel.</p>
    
            <h2>‚è≥ Take Your Time</h2>
            <p>If you‚Äôre offered something that feels off, it‚Äôs okay to ask for time. Say, <em>‚ÄúThank you ‚Äî I‚Äôd love to take a day or two to consider the offer.‚Äù</em> Professional. Assertive. Respectful.</p>
    
            <p>üí™ As a new girl in tech, your ideas, skills, and voice matter. Don‚Äôt be afraid to advocate for yourself. The right role will honour your worth ‚Äî and you‚Äôre more than worth it.</p>
